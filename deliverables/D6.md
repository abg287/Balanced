# 1. Introduction

Balanced is a free meal planning website that helps young adults in college, and gym goers, maintain healthy dietary habits by tracking the nutritional value of their previous meals and offering personalized recommendations to meet their nutritional needs for their next meal.

Balanced is still in the works of getting all it’s features finalized, but it currently includes its main features of a simple interface, logging meals, tracking physical data, like weight and height, a database that stores food for users to see what they’ve eaten, and adding meals to the database. Future plans include profile creation, food recommendations, bmr calculator, progress tracking, and feedback submission.

# 3. Tests

## 3.1 Unit tests

Automated tests will be linked [here](https://github.com/abg287/Balanced/tree/main/src/tests). The test framework used was unittests. The package "jest" tests the website's forms for form validation or actions expected. Below is a snippet of code that tests [AddFood.jsx](https://github.com/abg287/Balanced/blob/main/src/client/components/AddFood.jsx) to see if the additional options button works (Press [here](https://github.com/abg287/Balanced/blob/main/src/tests/AddFood.test.jsx) to the link of AddFood.test.jsx):

## 3.2 Acceptance tests

An acceptance test is a test that verifies the correct implementation of a feature from the user interface perspective. An acceptance test is a black box test (the system is tested without knowledge about its internal implementation). Provide the following information:

Test framework you used to develop your tests (e.g., Selenium, Katalon Studio, Espresso2, Cucumber, etc.)
Link to your GitHub folder where your automated acceptance tests are located
An example of an acceptance test. Include a GitHub link to the test and an explanation about the tested feature in your answer.
A print screen/video showing the acceptance test execution
Grading criteria (2 points): adequate choice of a test framework, coverage of the tests, quality of the tests, adequate example of an acceptance test, print screen/video showing successful test execution.

The acceptance test will be linked [here](https://github.com/abg287/Balanced/tree/main/src/tests). The test framework used to develop our tests was Jest. Jest creates mock websites to input values inside forms for all of our components in the website. Below is a picture that tests one of our forms that input's the user's physical metrics. It tests it by inputting normal values and expecting it to accept the input and update it within the website. Test will be linked [here](https://github.com/abg287/Balanced/blob/main/src/tests/PhysicalData.test.jsx).

Below is the execution of the acceptance test and it'll show what was accepted or failed.

# 4. Demo

Include a link to a video showing the system working.

Grading criteria (10 points): This section will be graded based on the quality of the video and on the evidence that the features are running as expected. Additional criteria are the relevance of the demonstrated functionalities, the correctness of the functionalities, and the quality of the developed system from the external point of view (user interface).

# 5. Code Quality

Our team managed code quality by applying JavaScript linters on our files to ensure our code follows JavaScript standards. This would then help us as a team to manage a clean and organized repository. The adopted best practice we did was initialize variables/functions at the start of a file or function so we know what each variable does. This helps organize the high-quality code. A convention in JavaScript is to set functions as constant variables, so React can have an easier time accessing it and better syntax looks, which leads to high-quality code. Lastly, the policies we applied to our project was to always explain code whether it was in comments, commit descriptions, or in real life. This helps us learn more about React as some teammates in Balanced are not well informed about React.

# 6. Lessons Learned

In retrospect, describe what your team learned during this second release and what you would change if you would continue developing the project. 

Grading criteria (2 points): Adequate reflection about problems and solutions, clear description with adequate use of language.
