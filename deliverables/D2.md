2. Operability - The layout of the website is intuitive and can easily be navigated. Measurement: 90% of testers have no issue navigating the website
3. Compatibility - Website appears correctly on all devices. Measurement: No buttons are cut-off on different devices.
4. Performance - Loading times are short and quickly responds to user input. Measurement: 80% of testers have no complaints about the load times.

## 5. Minimum Value Proposition (MVP)

Developing the minimum viable product would require 3 key processes. Firstly, the website should be developed. This would require a local-sided set-up for development and testing, and later a fully established server should be prepared. Secondly, the product would need the functional requirements implemented. The most important of these would be the meal logging and recommendation system. These should be developed first, as they work together and separate our product from the competition. Last is the testing and validation phase. Once the main set of features are prototyped, they should be validated through a series of tests. Testers should connect to the official server, rather than running the program locally, and these testers should be people we know who can give us feedback and opinions; so we can further improve the product.
