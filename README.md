# Balanced

Balanced is a free meal planning website that helps young adults in college, and gym goers, maintain healthy dietary habits by tracking the nutritional value of their previous meals and offering personalized recommendations to meet their nutritional needs for their next meal.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

- Install [node and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm#checking-your-version-of-npm-and-nodejs) 
to your computer.
- Pull the latest version of the remote repository main branch to your local
repository branch.
- More to be listed, if any...

### Installing

1. The .gitignore file ignores a very important folder, "node_modules", since it
contains many files. To attain this folder, run

~~~
npm i
~~~

to get the folder.
3. After getting the "node_modules" folder, run

~~~
npm run dev
~~~

to start the 
local website.
